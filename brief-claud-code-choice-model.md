# Briefing Document: Optimizing Claude Code Usage Through Manual Model Selection

**Main Topics and Key Ideas:**

This document examines the key aspects of using Claude Code, focusing on its default model selection behavior and strategies for optimizing cost and efficiency.

**1. Drawbacks of Claude Code's Default Settings:**

* **Lack of intelligent model selection by default:** Claude Code always directs requests through its most powerful and expensive modelâ€”Opus 4. As noted, "by default, Claude code always routes your request through Anthropic's most powerful model, Opus 4." This occurs regardless of the request's complexity.
* **High cost of Opus 4:** Opus 4 is five times more expensive than Sonnet 4. "Opus 4 is five times more costly than Sonnet 4." This leads to significant token overspending and reaching usage limits quickly.
* **Reactive model switching:** Claude Code only switches to Sonnet 4 when "your usage approaches 20% of your allocated quota." This switch is not strategic but merely reactive, occurring when the user is "running out of capacity." This switching threshold has changed (from 100% to 50%, and then to 20%), indicating Anthropic's attempts to find a balance.
* **Comparison with other tools:** Unlike Claude Code, "other tools, such as Cursor, offer intelligent model switching by default," optimizing performance and cost.

**2. Demonstration of Default Settings' Inefficiency:**

* An experiment conducted with a simple query "what is 1 + 1" showed a significant cost difference:
    * Using Opus 4 (default): 25 cents.
    * Using Sonnet 4 (manual selection): 5 cents.
* **Key takeaway:** "there is no added value in using Opus 4 for this type of task. The answer is the same, and the complexity is minimal." This highlights that an "Opus 4 run is about five times more expensive than a Sonnet 4 run" but does not provide better results for simple tasks.

**3. Importance of Manual Model Selection:**

* **Cost optimization:** Manual model selection allows you to "get more from your usage" and "avoid wasting tokens."
* **Matching the model to the task:** It allows you to use the "right level of performance for your task without burning tokens unnecessarily."

**4. How to Choose a Model Effectively:**

* **General rule:**
    * **Opus 4:** Use for tasks requiring "reasoning, problem-solving, or anything that would make you stop and think." Examples: complex algorithm design, debugging difficult trace issues, architectural planning, code optimization, significant refactoring.
    * **Sonnet 4 (or older models):** Use for more "procedural" tasks where the model just needs to "follow clear instructions." Examples: simple implementation, code generation from a clear plan, writing documentation and comments, fixing minor syntax and formatting errors.
* **The paradoxical effect of powerful models:** "Ironically, using a more powerful model does not always mean better results." For simple tasks, Opus 4 might "over-analyze the request," looking for depth that isn't there, which can lead to "overly complex, overly abstract, or even just plain wrong solutions." A lighter model like Sonnet 4 "will give you cleaner, more direct answers."

**5. Common Concerns and Strategies to Address Them:**

* **"This adds an extra step to my workflow":** It's a trade-off: "you are trading a bit of your time to save a significant number of tokens." If you frequently hit your limits, manual selection is worth it.
* **"Sonnet 4 doesn't understand my codebase as well as Opus 4":** While Opus 4 is better at handling complex logic and large codebases, Sonnet 4 can still be used effectively with a few strategies:
    * **Thinking mode:** Prompt Sonnet 4 to enter "thinking mode" by literally typing "think hard" in the prompt. This encourages the model to "think through the problem more thoroughly."
    * **More precise model guidance:** Be specific in your requests. Specify files/functions to focus on, and provide examples to follow. Structure requests around "one clearly defined and independent part of the codebase."
    * **Hybrid approach: Opus 4 for planning, Sonnet 4 for execution:**
        * **Planning with Opus 4:** Use Opus 4 for complex reasoning, such as understanding the codebase, designing system architecture, creating an implementation plan, developing a testing strategy, identifying edge cases, and compiling a task list.
        * **Execution with Sonnet 4:** For each item in the plan, switch to a new chat with Sonnet 4, copy the relevant context (implementation plan, system design, specific task), and use Sonnet 4 to perform that part of the work. Once completed, clear the context and repeat for the next task. This approach "gives you the best of both worlds."

**Key Conclusions:**

* The current default behavior of Claude Code leads to significant and unnecessary token costs due to the constant use of the expensive Opus 4 model, even for simple tasks.
* Anthropic will likely introduce a more intelligent model selection system in the future, but for now, this feature is absent.
* Active manual model selection (Opus 4 for complex reasoning, Sonnet 4 for procedural tasks) is the best way to optimize workflow, save costs, and get the most out of Claude Code.
* Even for complex tasks, Sonnet 4 can be used effectively through strategies like thinking mode, more precise instructions, and a hybrid approach with Opus 4 for planning.
